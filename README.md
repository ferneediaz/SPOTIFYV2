## TECH STACK

The frontend of this application was built using NEXT.js, a powerful framework that provides server-side rendering, resulting in improved performance and search engine optimization. NEXT.js also features built-in TypeScript support, which enhances code reliability and maintainability.

Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, was utilized to swiftly and consistently style components. With a vast community and well-documented resources, Tailwind CSS enabled us to rapidly overcome any styling hurdles encountered during development.

To manage the application's state in a scalable and efficient manner, RecoilJS, a lightweight and user-friendly state management library that seamlessly integrates with React components, was employed.

Please note that the player might not work if you're using a free account, spotify terms of use prohibits the use of player of free users.
